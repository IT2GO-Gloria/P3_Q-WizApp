Charles Chase (team lead), Reveé Watts, Jerome Payne,
Gloria Johnston, Jamal Khan, Carlos Leon, and Eric Taylor

This Q-Wiz app is a basic app that allows a user to login, create a quiz, take a quiz,
and earn points for taking a quiz and getting all the answers correct.

Charles Chase was team lead, the rest of us were broken down into front and back end.
Gloria Johnston and Eric Taylor also created the database tables while doing other roles.
We all of course, helped out each other the whole time we were creating this app.
